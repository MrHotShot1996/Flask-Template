# Flask-Template
A quick organized Flask boilerplate with very basic needs, just clone and it's ready to go!
This was made due to my fustration of needing simple but yet effective Flask template.

To get started: 
1- clone existing folder to whatever path you want
2- make sure to pip install requirements.txt by >> pip install -r requirements.txt (on windows)
